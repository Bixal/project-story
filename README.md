# Rapid prototyping for the web using the U.S. Web Design System

At Bixal, we believe fast cycles of prototyping and testing accelerate learning, reduce risk, and improve outcomes. We started a dedicated internal team to explore new processes and tools for using web-based prototyping to help our delivery teams lower the barriers to making ideas more tangible more quickly.

If you're here, you'll probably be joining our event where we, the Rapid Response team, will be presenting who we are and what we're all about. 

We'll take you through a case study on how we improved the HHS OCR complaint portal assistant and then we'll walk you step-by-step on how to use our template to create your own complaint form screener. 

## What to do before the event

These suggestions are all optional, but if you're interested, you may get more out of time together if you do these things ahead of time:
- Read a summary of the project we'll be covering.
- Poke around the [live site](https://bixal.github.io/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool/) to see how it works.
- Read the [readme](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool#readme) of the GitHub project.
- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/).
- Try following the [instructions](https://github.com/Bixal/uswds-screener-prototyping-tool#how-to) in the readme for using our project as a template for your own project. And bring any questions or issues you run into!
